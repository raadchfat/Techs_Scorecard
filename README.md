2. **Excel Parsing**: Extract data from specified sheets using SheetJS
3. **Data Cleaning**: Normalize dates, parse currency/percentages, clean strings
4. **Data Integration**: Join datasets using Job ID relationships
5. **Week Filtering**: Filter data to selected week range
6. **Technician Grouping**: Group data by technician name
7. **KPI Calculation**: Compute all 8 metrics per technician
8. **Results Display**: Present data in interactive dashboard format

## Error Handling

The application provides comprehensive error handling for:
